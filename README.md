# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The data used in this project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
From the original data, the files used for analysis were the following:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Binding the Training and Test sets to their respective labels and subjects and then to each other, the data set allData was created.

Melting and casting allData was possible to create tidyData, a data set that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
